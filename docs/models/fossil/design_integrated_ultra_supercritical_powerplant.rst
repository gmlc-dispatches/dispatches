.. _Design of Integrated Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant:

Design of Integrated Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant
=================================================

The Design of Integrated Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant is comprised of two superstructure models to determine the optimal design of charge and discharge cycles of a thermal energy storage system (TES) integrated with a pulverized coal-fired ultra-supercritical power plant. The superstructure models are formulated using Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) and include discrete and continuous design decisions. The discrete design decisions are included as disjunctions and identify the optimal integration points of TES with the power plant, while the continuous design decisions are the size and operating conditions of TES. A conceptual representation of each superstructure is shown in the flowsheets below, where the green dotted and dashed lines represent the discrete design decisions for each storage cycle integrated with the power plant.

Model Structure
---------------

For the construction of the charge and discharge GDP design models, the power plant model described in :ref:`Ultra-Supercritical Power Plant` is used as the base model to integrate the storage system. The charge cycle of TES uses a heat exchanger, a splitter, a cooler, and a pump, while the discharge cycle uses a heat exchanger, a splitter, and a turbine `ST`, where `ST` is used to produce additional power using the steam generated from the discharge heat exchanger.  Both, charge and discharge design models use unit models from the IDAES power generation unit model library, the IAPWS property package for steam and water, and the property packages for Solar Salt Property Package, Hitec Salt Property Package, and :ref:`Thermal Oil Property Package`. The unit models used in the design superstructures are shown in the table below:

Discrete Design Decisions
-------------------------
The charge superstructure includes two disjunctions for the optimal integration of the charge cycle. Disjunction 1 selects either Solar salt, Hitec salt, or Thermal oil as the heat transfer fluid for the charge heat exchanger. Disjunction 2 selects between a very high-pressure or high-pressure steam as the heat source for the charge heat exchanger. Given the two disjunctions, the charge superstructure considers 6 alternative flowsheet configurations. The different design alternatives are given in the following table:

============================== ============ ========================================================
Charge Design Decisions         Disjunction Description
============================== ============ ========================================================
:math:`solar_-salt_-disjunct`  1            Disjunct 1 to select solar salt as the storage material in charge heat exchanger
:math:`hitec_-salt_-disjunct`  1            Disjunct 2 to select hitec salt as the storage material in charge heat exchanger
:math:`thermal_-oil_-disjunct` 1            Disjunct 3 to select solar salt as the storage material in charge heat exchanger
:math:`VHP_-source_-disjunct`  2            Disjunct 1 to select a very high-pressure steam from the power plant to charge the storage system
:math:`HP_-source_-disjunct`   2            Disjunct 2 to select a high-pressure steam from the power plant to charge the storage system
============================== ============ ========================================================

The discharge superstructure includes one disjunction to select the condensate source to generate steam in the discharge heat exchanger. Given the condensate disjunction, the discharge superstructure considers 5 alternative flowsheet configurations. The alternative design decisions are given in the following table:

============================== =========== ==========================================================
