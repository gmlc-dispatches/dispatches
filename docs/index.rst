DISPATCHES
==========
The **D**\ esign **I**\ ntegration and **S**\ ynthesis **P**\ latform to **A**\ dvance **T**\ ightly
**C**\ oupled **H**\ ybrid **E**\ nergy **S**\ ystems (DISPATCHES) project, is being developed and
used to identify and optimize Integrated Energy Systems for operation within the bulk power system
via energy market signals.

`DISPATCHES <https://gmlc-dispatches.github.io/>`_ is part of the `DOE Grid
Modernization Laboratory Consortium (GMLC)
<https://www.energy.gov/gmi/grid-modernization-lab-consortium>`_.


Value Proposition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Deployment of integrated hybrid energy systems is expected to increase in coming years and no single
platform exists for dynamic modeling of these systems as they interact with the bulk power
system. Addresses 3 major challenges:

* Conceptual design of novel hybrid systems in a way that enables rigorous exploration of the design
  space
* Values the output of the hybrid system within the context of the grid and region it is deployed
* Detailed dynamic models coupled with nonlinear model predictive control based on market signals


Project Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Open, transparent, multi-lab computational platform to support the design, optimization, and
analysis of tightly coupled hybrid systems.  Demonstrate and quantify the benefits of potential
hybrid systems based on 3 case studies:

* Coal (existing and Coal FIRST) with energy storage, etc.
* Existing nuclear with hydrogen production and utilization
* Renewables with dispatchable options (batteries, NGCC)
* Build on DOE investments in modeling and simulation capabilities to support a resilient, reliable,
  and cost-effective bulk power system.
