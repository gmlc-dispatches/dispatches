    "# Integrated Energy Systems: Nuclear Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we formulate a multi-period optimization problem that determines the optimal design of an integrated energy system producing electricity and hydrogen such that its net present value (NPV) is maximized for a given market signal. We consider an **existing** nuclear power plant of 1000 MW capcity as the genator. In general, due to safety restrictions, nuclear power plants are not amenable for ramping. Therefore, we assume that the power plant always operates at its base load (i.e., 1000 MW). We are interested in determining whether the following options are attractive (i.e., maximize NPV):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce hydrogen using a portion of the electricity, especially during periods of low electricity demand, and sell it.\n",
    "- Produce hydrogen, store it in a tank, and combust it to produce electrity during the periods of high electricity demand.\n",

    "Here, we use a PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer to produce hydrogen via water electrolysis. Current PEM technology requires ~54 kWh/kg of hydrogen (see https://www.h-tec.com/en/products/detail/h-tec-pem-electrolyser-me100-350/me100-350/ , last accessed on February 18, 2022). The produced hydrogen is stored in a tank, which can either be sold to the market via a pipeline, or combusted in a hydrogen turbine to produce electricity during the periods of high demand for electricity. Note that\n",

If needed, the `SimplifiedHydrogenTank` model in the flowsheet can be replaced with a more detailed tank model (the DISPATCHES repository has a more detailed tank model that enforces enthalpy balance as well).\n",
    "- The hydrogen turbine is modeled as a compressor, a stochiometric reactor, and a turbine connected in series. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the flowsheet model, we use two different thermodynamic packages: one for the PEM electrolyzer and the hydrogen tank, and the other for the mixer and the hydrogen turbine. This is because, the material stream(s) to and from the former units only contain hydrogen. Whereas, the material stream(s) to and from the latter units contain nitrogen, oxygen, water and argon, in addition to hydrogen. The translator block facilitates the use of multiple thermodynamic packages by connecting properties across the packages. \n",

    "### LMP Signal\n",
    "Our objective is to determine the optimal size of the PEM, tank and turbine maximizing the NPV for a given 'market signal'. Throughout the notebook, by market signal or price signal, we refer to the locational marginal price (LMP) (selling price of electricity, in $/MWh) as a function of time. The LMP depends on several factors such as weather, demand, generator mix of the grid, and so forth. Owing to the uncertain nature of some those factors, it is not possible to predict the exact value of the LMP way into the future. Nevertheless, in this section, we **assume that the LMP signal is accurate** (i.e., there is no uncertainty in the price). Later, we show how the same framework/workflow can be used to easily formulate a stochastic program to handle the uncertainty in the price signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use the LMP data contained in the file `lmp_signal.json`. This dataset is generated by FORCE (link goes here) using the 2019/2020 New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) price data. FORCE divides the 365 days of a year into a specified number of clusters (20, in our case), and generates the LMP signal for each cluster (Note that the LMP signal is the same for all the days of a cluster). The figure below plots the LMP signal for cluster 1 (left) and cluster 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](sample_lmp_plots.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As evident from the figure, the price can vary significantly in a day, and from cluster to cluster. Given the variation, we are interested in determining if producing hydrogen, especially during the periods when LMP is low, is attractive or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the demonstration, we do not use the entire dataset in `lmp_signal.json`. Instead, we use the LMP signal only for the years 2022 and 2032. We assume that the plant lifetime is twenty years. We use the 2022 LMP signal for the first ten years (i.e., 2022 - 2031), and the 2032 LMP signal for the next ten years (i.e., 2032 - 2041). If desired, the LMP data for the intermediate years can be easily included in the model with a slight modification to the code."

This function creates an instance of the flowsheet (using the `build_ne_flowsheet` function) for each time instance, fixes its degrees of freedom and initializes it (using the `fix_dof_and_initialize` function), and unfixes operational degrees of freedom (using the `unfix_dof` function) described above. Since we are dealing with multiple days/clusters and multiple years (2022 and 2032 LMP signals), we set the `multiple_days` and `multiyear` argument to `True` (see below. Note that the default value of these arguments is `False`). \n",
